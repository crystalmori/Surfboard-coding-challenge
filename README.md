# Requirements

We expect this assignment to take 1 hour to program. You may use any stack, import any third-party libraries, consult any documentation, and use any existing code that you have written or otherwise are legally allowed to be used (such as open source). However, given that our stack is written in `React` and `TypeScript`, we would prefer that you use those.

# Implementation

Please design and implement a product for users to run investor meetings in. Your product should meet the following product requirements, at a minimum:

- An agenda
    - A list of meeting topics
        - Each topic contains a title, time estimate, and a text description
    - Users should be able to navigate between topics
    - The presenter should be able to add, delete and edit topics

### Extra credit

If you've finished the product requirements above, the following would also be cool (though not necessary):

- Your design is easy to use
- Users can communicate with each other in some way (chat, audio, etc.)
- Some way to keep track of whether the meeting is running on time
- Topics have content beyond normal text (like rich text, links, images, attachments)
- Users can see who is looking at which topics
- Other features not listed here that you think would be useful for the user

# Demo

Please record a short 5 minute video of your solution.

- Demonstrate the product and how it is used
- Explain your code at a high level. (Architecture decisions, stack, design, ...)
- You may also discuss any problems you ran into and how you dealt with them

# Submission

Please send an email to team@surfboard.team with the following:

- Link to your code (such as a git repository or repl.it)
- Link to your video
